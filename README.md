# Card Trick Challenge
A study of React fundamentals.

## How it works:
- Pick a card
- Tell me which stack is it in
- I'll show you what card it is!

## Tasks:

### Task 1
- Generate a 52 cards deck, shuffle and choose 21 random cards for the trick

### Task 2
- Show the user those 21 cards in 3 rows of 7 cards
- Source for button css: https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples

### Task 3 
Implement the trick:
- The user must pick a card
- The user must select which stack their card is in
- Rearrange and repeat according to the trick steps

Every function must have tests

### Task 4
- Reveal the chosen card
- Create a 'Play again' button
  - Which returns a newly shuffled and random set of 21 cards

### Task 5
Test every component using Jest and RTL
